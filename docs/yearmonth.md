</details>

A `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` represents a particular month on the calendar.
For example, it could be used to represent a particular instance of a monthly recurring event, like "the June 2019 meeting".

`Temporal.PlainYearMonth` refers to the whole of a specific month; if you need to refer to a calendar event on a certain day, use `Temporal.PlainDate` or even `Temporal.PlainDateTime`.
A `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` can be converted into a `Temporal.PlainDate` by combining it with a day of the month, using the `toPlainDate()` method.

## Constructor

### **new Temporal.PlainYearMonth**(_isoYear_: number, _isoMonth_: number, _calendar_?: object, _referenceISODay_: number = 1) : Temporal.PlainYearMonth

**Parameters:**

- `isoYear` (number): A year.
- `isoMonth` (number): A month, ranging between 1 and 12 inclusive.
- `calendar` (optional `Temporal.Calendar` or plain object): A calendar to project the month into.
- `referenceISODay` (optional number): A reference day, used for disambiguation when implementing other calendar systems.
  You can omit this parameter unless using a non-ISO-8601 calendar.

**Returns:** a new `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` object.

Use this constructor if you have the correct parameters already as individual number values in the ISO 8601 calendar, or you are implementing a custom calendar.
Otherwise, `Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from()`, which accepts more kinds of input, allows months in other calendar systems, and allows controlling the overflow behaviour, is probably more convenient.

All values are given as reckoned in the [ISO 8601 calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Dates).
Together, `isoYear`, `isoMonth`, and `referenceISODay` must represent a valid date in that calendar, even if you are passing a different calendar as the `calendar` parameter.

The range of allowed values for this type is exactly enough that calling [`toPlainYearMonth()`](./date.html#toPlainYearMonth) on any valid `Temporal.PlainDate` will succeed.
If `isoYear` and `isoMonth` are outside of this range, then this function will throw a `RangeError`.

> **NOTE**: The `isoMonth` argument ranges from 1 to 12, which is different from legacy `Date` where months are represented by zero-based indices (0 to 11).

Usage examples:

```javascript
// The June 2019 meeting
ym = new Temporal.PlainYearMonth(2019, 6); // => 2019-06
```

## Static methods

### Temporal.PlainYearMonth.**from**(_thing_: any, _options_?: object) : Temporal.PlainYearMonth

**Parameters:**

- `thing`: The value representing the desired month.
- `options` (optional object): An object with properties representing options for constructing the date.
  The following options are recognized:
  - `overflow` (string): How to deal with out-of-range values in `thing`.
    Allowed values are `constrain` and `reject`.
    The default is `constrain`.

**Returns:** a new `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` object.

This static method creates a new `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` object from another value.
If the value is another `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` object, a new object representing the same month is returned.
If the value is any other object, it must have `year` and `month` properties, and optionally `era` and `calendar` properties.
If `calendar` is a calendar that requires `era` (such as the Japanese calendar), then the `era` property must also be present.
A `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` will be constructed from these properties.

If the `calendar` property is not present, it will be assumed to be `Temporal.Calendar.from('iso8601')`, the [ISO 8601 calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Dates).
In this calendar, `era` is ignored.

Any non-object value is converted to a string, which is expected to be in ISO 8601 format.
Any parts of the string other than the year and the month are optional and will be ignored.
If the string isn't valid according to ISO 8601, then a `RangeError` will be thrown regardless of the value of `overflow`.

The `overflow` option works as follows:

- In `constrain` mode (the default), any out-of-range values are clamped to the nearest in-range value.
- In `reject` mode, the presence of out-of-range values will cause the function to throw a `RangeError`.

Additionally, if the result is earlier or later than the range of dates that `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` can represent (approximately half a million years centered on the [Unix epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)), then this method will throw a `RangeError` regardless of `overflow`.

> **NOTE**: The allowed values for the `thing.month` property start at 1, which is different from legacy `Date` where months are represented by zero-based indices (0 to 11).

Example usage:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```javascript
ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2019-06'); // => 2019-06
ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2019-06-24'); // => 2019-06
ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2019-06-24T15:43:27'); // => 2019-06
ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2019-06-24T15:43:27Z'); // => 2019-06
ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2019-06-24T15:43:27+01:00[Europe/Brussels]');
  // => 2019-06
ym === Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from(ym); // => true

ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from({ year: 2019, month: 6 }); // => 2019-06
ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from(Temporal.PlainDate.from('2019-06-24'));
  // => same as above; Temporal.PlainDate has year and month properties

// Different overflow modes
ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from({ year: 2001, month: 13 }, { overflow: 'constrain' });
  // => 2001-12
ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from({ year: 2001, month: -1 }, { overflow: 'constrain' });
  // => 2001-01
ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from({ year: 2001, month: 13 }, { overflow: 'reject' });
  // throws
ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from({ year: 2001, month: -1 }, { overflow: 'reject' });
  // throws
```

### Temporal.PlainYearMonth.**compare**(_one_: Temporal.PlainYearMonth | object | string, _two_: Temporal.PlainYearMonth | object | string) : number

**Parameters:**

- `one` (`Temporal.PlainYearMonth` or value convertible to one): First month to compare.
- `two` (`Temporal.PlainYearMonth` or value convertible to one): Second month to compare.

**Returns:** &minus;1, 0, or 1.

Compares two `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` objects.
Returns an integer indicating whether `one` comes before or after or is equal to `two`.

- &minus;1 if `one` comes before `two`;
- 0 if `one` and `two` are the same;
- 1 if `one` comes after `two`.

If `one` and `two` are not `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` objects, then they will be converted to one as if they were passed to `Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from()`.

This function can be used to sort arrays of `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` objects.
For example:

```javascript
one = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2006-08');
two = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2015-07');
three = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('1930-02');
sorted = [one, two, three].sort(Temporal.PlainYearMonth.compare);
sorted.join(' '); // => 1930-02 2006-08 2015-07
```

## Properties

### yearMonth.**year** : number

### yearMonth.**month** : number

The above read-only properties allow accessing the year and month individually.

> **NOTE**: The possible values for the `month` property start at 1, which is different from legacy `Date` where months are represented by zero-based indices (0 to 11).

Usage examples:

```javascript
ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2019-06');
ym.year; // => 2019
ym.month; // => 6
```

### yearMonth.**calendar** : object

The `calendar` read-only property gives the calendar that the `year` and `month` properties are interpreted in.

### yearMonth.**daysInMonth** : number

The `daysInMonth` read-only property gives the number of days in the month.
This is 28, 29, 30, or 31, depending on the month and whether the year is a leap year.

Usage example:

```javascript
// Attempt to write some mnemonic poetry
const monthsByDays = {};
for (let month = 1; month <= 12; month++) {
  const ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from({ year: 2020, month });
  monthsByDays[ym.daysInMonth] = (monthsByDays[ym.daysInMonth] || []).concat(ym);
}

const strings = monthsByDays[30].map((ym) => ym.toLocaleString('en', { month: 'long' }));
// Shuffle to improve poem as determined empirically
strings.unshift(strings.pop());
const format = new Intl.ListFormat('en');
const poem = `Thirty days hath ${format.format(strings)}`;

console.log(poem);
```

### yearMonth.**daysInYear** : number

The `daysInYear` read-only property gives the number of days in the year that the month falls in.
This is 365 or 366, depending on whether the year is a leap year.

Usage example:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```javascript
ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2019-06');
percent = ym.daysInMonth / ym.daysInYear;
`${ym.toLocaleString('en', {month: 'long', year: 'numeric'})} was ${percent.toLocaleString('en', {style: 'percent'})} of the year!`
  // => example output: "June 2019 was 8% of the year!"
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### yearMonth.**monthsInYear**: number

The `monthsInYear` read-only property gives the number of months in the year that the month falls in.
For the ISO 8601 calendar, this is always 12, but in other calendar systems it may differ from year to year.

Usage example:

```javascript
ym = Temporal.PlainDate.from('1900-01');
ym.monthsInYear; // => 12
```

### yearMonth.**inLeapYear** : boolean

The `inLeapYear` read-only property tells whether the year that the date falls in is a leap year or not.
Its value is `true` if the year is a leap year, and `false` if not.

Usage example:

```javascript
// Was June 2019 in a leap year?
ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2019-06');
ym.inLeapYear; // => false
// Is 2100 a leap year? (no, because it's divisible by 100 and not 400)
ym.with({ year: 2100 }).inLeapYear; // => false
```

## Methods

### yearMonth.**with**(_yearMonthLike_: object, _options_?: object) : Temporal.PlainYearMonth

**Parameters:**

- `yearMonthLike` (object): an object with some or all of the properties of a `Temporal.PlainYearMonth`.
- `options` (optional object): An object with properties representing options for the operation.
  The following options are recognized:
  - `overflow` (string): How to deal with out-of-range values.
    Allowed values are `constrain` and `reject`.
    The default is `constrain`.

**Returns:** a new `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` object.

This method creates a new `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` which is a copy of `yearMonth`, but any properties present on `yearMonthLike` override the ones already present on `yearMonth`.

Since `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` objects are immutable, use this method instead of modifying one.

If the result is earlier or later than the range of dates that `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` can represent (approximately half a million years centered on the [Unix epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)), then this method will throw a `RangeError` regardless of `overflow`.

> **NOTE**: The allowed values for the `yearMonthLike.month` property start at 1, which is different from legacy `Date` where months are represented by zero-based indices (0 to 11).

> **NOTE**: Unlike in `Temporal.PlainDate.prototype.with()`, a `calendar` property is not allowed on `yearMonthLike`.
> It is not possible to convert a `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` to another calendar system without knowing the day of the month.
> If you need to do this, use `yearMonth.toPlainDate({ day }).withCalendar(calendar).toPlainYearMonth()`.

Usage example:

```javascript
ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2019-06');
// Get December of that year
ym.with({ month: 12 }); // => 2019-12
```

### yearMonth.**add**(_duration_: Temporal.Duration | object | string, _options_?: object) : Temporal.PlainYearMonth

**Parameters:**

- `duration` (`Temporal.Duration` or value convertible to one): The duration to add.
- `options` (optional object): An object with properties representing options for the addition.
  The following options are recognized:
  - `overflow` (string): How to deal with additions that result in out-of-range values.
    Allowed values are `constrain` and `reject`.
    The default is `constrain`.

**Returns:** a new `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` object which is the month indicated by `yearMonth` plus `duration`.

This method adds `duration` to `yearMonth`, returning a month that is in the future relative to `yearMonth`.

The `duration` argument is an object with properties denoting a duration, such as `{ months: 5 }`, or a string such as `P5M`, or a `Temporal.Duration` object.
If `duration` is not a `Temporal.Duration` object, then it will be converted to one as if it were passed to `Temporal.Duration.from()`.

If the result is earlier or later than the range of dates that `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` can represent (approximately half a million years centered on the [Unix epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)), then this method will throw a `RangeError` regardless of `overflow`.

The `overflow` option has no effect in the default ISO calendar, because a year is always 12 months and therefore not ambiguous.
It doesn't matter in this case that years and months can be different numbers of days, as the resolution of `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` does not distinguish days.
However, `overflow` may have an effect in other calendars where years can be different numbers of months.

Adding a negative duration is equivalent to subtracting the absolute value of that duration.

Usage example:

```javascript
ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2019-06');
ym.add({ years: 20, months: 4 }); // => 2039-10
```

### yearMonth.**subtract**(_duration_: Temporal.Duration | object | string, _options_?: object) : Temporal.PlainYearMonth

**Parameters:**

- `duration` (`Temporal.Duration` or value convertible to one): The duration to subtract.
- `options` (optional object): An object with properties representing options for the subtraction.
  The following options are recognized:
  - `overflow` (string): How to deal with additions that result in out-of-range values.
    Allowed values are `constrain` and `reject`.
    The default is `constrain`.

**Returns:** a new `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` object which is the month indicated by `yearMonth` minus `duration`.

This method subtracts `duration` from `yearMonth`, returning a month that is in the future relative to `yearMonth`.

The `duration` argument is an object with properties denoting a duration, such as `{ months: 5 }`, or a string such as `P5M`, or a `Temporal.Duration` object.
If `duration` is not a `Temporal.Duration` object, then it will be converted to one as if it were passed to `Temporal.Duration.from()`.

If the result is earlier or later than the range of dates that `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` can represent (approximately half a million years centered on the [Unix epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)), then this method will throw a `RangeError` regardless of `overflow`.

The `overflow` option has no effect in the default ISO calendar, because a year is always 12 months and therefore not ambiguous.
It doesn't matter in this case that years and months can be different numbers of days, as the resolution of `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` does not distinguish days.
However, `overflow` may have an effect in other calendars where years can be different numbers of months.

Subtracting a negative duration is equivalent to adding the absolute value of that duration.

Usage example:

```javascript
ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2019-06');
ym.subtract({ years: 20, months: 4 }); // => 1999-02
```

### yearMonth.**until**(_other_: Temporal.PlainYearMonth | object | string, _options_?: object) : Temporal.Duration

**Parameters:**

- `other` (`Temporal.PlainYearMonth` or value convertible to one): Another month until when to compute the difference.
- `options` (optional object): An object with properties representing options for the operation.
  The following options are recognized:
  - `largestUnit` (string): The largest unit of time to allow in the resulting `Temporal.Duration` object.
    Valid values are `'auto'`, `'years'` and `'months'`.
    The default is `'auto'`.
  - `smallestUnit` (string): The smallest unit of time to round to in the resulting `Temporal.Duration` object.
    Valid values are `'years'` and `'months'`.
    The default is `'months'`, i.e., no rounding.
  - `roundingIncrement` (number): The granularity to round to, of the unit given by `smallestUnit`.
    The default is 1.
  - `roundingMode` (string): How to handle the remainder, if rounding.
    Valid values are `'nearest'`, `'ceil'`, `'trunc'`, and `'floor'`.
    The default is `'nearest'`.

**Returns:** a `Temporal.Duration` representing the elapsed time after `yearMonth` and until `other`.

This method computes the difference between the two months represented by `yearMonth` and `other`, optionally rounds it, and returns it as a `Temporal.Duration` object.
If `other` is earlier than `yearMonth` then the resulting duration will be negative.

If `other` is not a `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` object, then it will be converted to one as if it were passed to `Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from()`.

The `largestUnit` option controls how the resulting duration is expressed.
The returned `Temporal.Duration` object will not have any nonzero fields that are larger than the unit in `largestUnit`.
A difference of one year and two months will become 14 months when `largestUnit` is `"months"`, for example.
However, a difference of one month will still be one month even if `largestUnit` is `"years"`.
A value of `'auto'` means `'years'`.

You can round the result using the `smallestUnit`, `roundingIncrement`, and `roundingMode` options.
These behave as in the `Temporal.Duration.round()` method, but increments of months and larger are allowed.
Because rounding to calendar units requires a reference point, the first day of `yearMonth` is used as the starting point.
The default is to do no rounding.

Unlike other Temporal types, weeks and lower are not allowed for either `largestUnit` or `smallestUnit`, because the data model of `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` doesn't have that accuracy.

Computing the difference between two months in different calendar systems is not supported.

Usage example:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```javascript
ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2006-08');
other = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2019-06');
ym.until(other);                            // => P12Y10M
ym.until(other, { largestUnit: 'months' }); // => P154M
other.until(ym, { largestUnit: 'months' }); // => -P154M

// If you really need to calculate the difference between two YearMonths
// in days, you can eliminate the ambiguity by explicitly choosing the
// day of the month (and if applicable, the time of that day) from which
// you want to reckon the difference. For example, using the first of
// the month to calculate a number of days:
ym.toPlainDate({ day: 1 }).until(other.toPlainDate({ day: 1 }), { largestUnit: 'days' }); // => P4687D
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### yearMonth.**since**(_other_: Temporal.PlainYearMonth | object | string, _options_?: object) : Temporal.Duration

**Parameters:**

- `other` (`Temporal.PlainYearMonth` or value convertible to one): Another month since when to compute the difference.
- `options` (optional object): An object with properties representing options for the operation.
  The following options are recognized:
  - `largestUnit` (string): The largest unit of time to allow in the resulting `Temporal.Duration` object.
    Valid values are `'auto'`, `'years'` and `'months'`.
    The default is `'auto'`.
  - `smallestUnit` (string): The smallest unit of time to round to in the resulting `Temporal.Duration` object.
    Valid values are `'years'` and `'months'`.
    The default is `'months'`, i.e., no rounding.
  - `roundingIncrement` (number): The granularity to round to, of the unit given by `smallestUnit`.
    The default is 1.
  - `roundingMode` (string): How to handle the remainder, if rounding.
    Valid values are `'nearest'`, `'ceil'`, `'trunc'`, and `'floor'`.
    The default is `'nearest'`.

**Returns:** a `Temporal.Duration` representing the elapsed time before `yearMonth` and since `other`.

This method computes the difference between the two months represented by `yearMonth` and `other`, optionally rounds it, and returns it as a `Temporal.Duration` object.
If `other` is later than `yearMonth` then the resulting duration will be negative.

This method does the same thing as the `Temporal.PlainYearMonth.prototype.until()` method, but reversed, and rounding takes place relative to `yearMonth` as an ending point instead of a starting point.
With the default options, the outcome of `ym1.since(ym2)` is the same as `ym1.until(ym2).negated()`.

Usage example:

```javascript
ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2019-06');
other = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2006-08');
ym.since(other); // => P12Y10M
```

### yearMonth.**equals**(_other_: Temporal.PlainYearMonth | object | string) : boolean

**Parameters:**

- `other` (`Temporal.PlainYearMonth` or value convertible to one): Another month to compare.

**Returns:** `true` if `yearMonth` and `other` are equal, or `false` if not.

Compares two `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` objects for equality.

This function exists because it's not possible to compare using `yearMonth == other` or `yearMonth === other`, due to ambiguity in the primitive representation and between Temporal types.

If `other` is not a `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` object, then it will be converted to one as if it were passed to `Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from()`.

Note that equality of two months from different calendar systems only makes sense in a few cases, such as when the two calendar systems both use the Gregorian year.

Even if you are using the same calendar system, if you don't need to know the order in which the two months occur, then this function may be less typing and more efficient than `Temporal.PlainYearMonth.compare`.

Example usage:

```javascript
ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2019-06');
other = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2006-08');
ym.equals(other); // => false
ym.equals(ym); // => true
```

### yearMonth.**toString**() : string

**Parameters:**

- `options` (optional object): An object with properties influencing the formatting.
  The following options are recognized:
  - `calendar` (string): Whether to show the calendar annotation in the return value.
    Valid values are `'auto'`, `'always'`, and `'never'`.
    The default is `'auto'`.

**Returns:** a string in the ISO 8601 date format representing `yearMonth`.

This method overrides the `Object.prototype.toString()` method and provides a convenient, unambiguous string representation of `yearMonth`.
The string can be passed to `Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from()` to create a new `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` object.

Normally, a calendar annotation is shown when `yearMonth`'s calendar is not the ISO 8601 calendar.
By setting the `calendar` option to `'always'` or `'never'` this can be overridden to always or never show the annotation, respectively.
For more information on the calendar annotation, see [ISO string extensions](./iso-string-ext.md#calendar-systems).

Example usage:

```js
ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2019-06');
ym.toString(); // => 2019-06
```

### yearMonth.**toLocaleString**(_locales_?: string | array&lt;string&gt;, _options_?: object) : string

**Parameters:**

- `locales` (optional string or array of strings): A string with a BCP 47 language tag with an optional Unicode extension key, or an array of such strings.
- `options` (optional object): An object with properties influencing the formatting.

**Returns:** a language-sensitive representation of `yearMonth`.

This method overrides `Object.prototype.toLocaleString()` to provide a human-readable, language-sensitive representation of `yearMonth`.

The `locales` and `options` arguments are the same as in the constructor to [`Intl.DateTimeFormat`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/DateTimeFormat).

The calendar in the output locale (given by `new Intl.DateTimeFormat(locales, options).resolvedOptions().calendar`) must match `monthDay.calendar`, or this method will throw an exception.
This is because it's not possible to convert a Temporal.PlainMonthDay from one calendar to another without more information.
In order to ensure that the output always matches `monthDay`'s internal calendar, you must either explicitly construct `monthDay` with the locale's calendar, or explicitly specify the calendar in the `options` parameter:

```js
yearMonth.toLocaleString(locales, { calendar: yearMonth.calendar });

// OR

yearMonth = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from({ /* ... */, calendar: localeCalendar });
yearMonth.toLocaleString();
```

Example usage:

```js
({ calendar } = new Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions());
ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from({ year: 2019, month: 6, calendar });
ym.toLocaleString(); // => example output: 2019-06
// Same as above, but explicitly specifying the calendar:
ym.toLocaleString(undefined, { calendar });

ym.toLocaleString('de-DE', { calendar }); // => example output: 6.2019
ym.toLocaleString('de-DE', { month: 'long', year: 'numeric', calendar }); // => Juni 2019
ym.toLocaleString(`en-US-u-nu-fullwide-u-ca-${calendar}`); // => ６/２０１９
```

### yearMonth.**toJSON**() : string

**Returns:** a string in the ISO 8601 date format representing `yearMonth`.

This method is the same as `yearMonth.toString()`.
It is usually not called directly, but it can be called automatically by `JSON.stringify()`.

The reverse operation, recovering a `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` object from a string, is `Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from()`, but it cannot be called automatically by `JSON.parse()`.
If you need to rebuild a `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` object from a JSON string, then you need to know the names of the keys that should be interpreted as `Temporal.PlainYearMonth`s.
In that case you can build a custom "reviver" function for your use case.

Example usage:

```js
const boardMeeting = {
  id: 4,
  agenda: ['Roll call', 'Budget'],
  meetingYearMonth: Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from({ year: 2019, month: 3 })
};
const str = JSON.stringify(boardMeeting, null, 2);
console.log(str);
// =>
// {
//   "id": 4,
//   "agenda": [
//     "Roll call",
//     "Budget"
//   ],
//   "meetingYearMonth": "2019-03"
// }

// To rebuild from the string:
function reviver(key, value) {
  if (key.endsWith('YearMonth')) return Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from(value);
  return value;
}
JSON.parse(str, reviver);
```

### yearMonth.**valueOf**()

This method overrides `Object.prototype.valueOf()` and always throws an exception.
This is because it's not possible to compare `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` objects with the relational operators `<`, `<=`, `>`, or `>=`.
Use `Temporal.PlainYearMonth.compare()` for this, or `yearMonth.equals()` for equality.

### yearMonth.**toPlainDate**(_day_: object) : Temporal.PlainDate

**Parameters:**

- `day` (object): An object with a `'day'` property, which must be a valid day of `yearMonth`.

**Returns:** a `Temporal.PlainDate` object that represents the calendar date of `day` in `yearMonth`.

This method can be used to convert `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` into a `Temporal.PlainDate`, by supplying a calendar day to use.
The converted object carries a copy of all the relevant fields of `yearMonth`.

Usage example:

```javascript
ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2019-06');
ym.toPlainDate({ day: 24 }); // => 2019-06-24
```

### yearMonth.**getFields**() : { year: number, month: number, calendar: object, [propName: string]: unknown }

**Returns:** a plain object with properties equal to the fields of `yearMonth`.

This method can be used to convert a `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` into a record-like data structure.
It returns a new plain JavaScript object, with all the fields as enumerable, writable, own data properties.

Note that if using a different calendar from ISO 8601, these will be the calendar-specific values and may include extra properties such as `era`.

> **NOTE**: The possible values for the `month` property of the returned object start at 1, which is different from legacy `Date` where months are represented by zero-based indices (0 to 11).

Usage example:

```javascript
ym = Temporal.PlainDateTime.from('2019-06');
Object.assign({}, ym).year; // => undefined
Object.assign({}, ym.getFields()).year; // => 2019
```

### yearMonth.**getISOFields**(): { isoYear: number, isoMonth: number, isoDay: number, calendar: object }

**Returns:** a plain object with properties expressing `yearMonth` in the ISO 8601 calendar, as well as the value of `yearMonth.calendar`.

This method is mainly useful if you are implementing a custom calendar.
Most code will not need to use it.
Use `yearMonth.getFields()` instead.

The value of the `isoDay` property will be equal to the `referenceISODay` constructor argument passed when `yearMonth` was constructed.

Usage example:

```javascript
ym = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from('2019-06');
ym.getISOFields().isoYear; // => 2019
```
